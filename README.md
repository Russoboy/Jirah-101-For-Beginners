How to use Jirah as a Beginners
1. Understand Jira Basics
Jira is a powerful tool to track tasks, bugs, and projects. It helps you organize work into issues (tasks) inside projects.

2. Set Up Your Project
Create a project with a clear name. Choose a template that fits your workflow — Scrum for Agile sprints, Kanban for continuous flow.

3. Create & Assign Issues
Break work into small tasks (issues). Add descriptions, deadlines, priority, and assign team members to each task.

4. Use Boards to Visualize Work
Kanban or Scrum boards show tasks in columns (To Do, In Progress, Done). Drag and drop issues as work progresses.

5. Plan Sprints (for Agile)
Set sprint duration, add issues to the sprint, and track progress using burndown charts.

6. Communicate & Collaborate
Use comments and mentions inside issues to keep everyone updated. Attach files, link related tasks.

7. Track Progress & Reports
Use Jira’s built-in reports to monitor team performance, deadlines, and bottlenecks.

8. Automate Repetitive Tasks
Set rules to automate workflows — like moving issues when status changes or sending reminders.
